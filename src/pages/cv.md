# Dean Merchant - CV

I am a UK based full-stack engineer with a particular enthiusiasm for front end work (❤️ React).

I love learning new technologies, languages, rock climbing and trying to get other people as enthusiastic about those pursuits as I am.

I have just finished a year long sabatical which I used to tour europes best rock climbing destinations.

Since I wasn't climbing every day I kept my skills sharp with a couple of projects:

- [FIA](https://figureit.app): A mobile app to help you deal with timezones (keeping in touch with friends is tricky!)
- Dice words with friends (Unpublished): I built a multi-player [boggle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggle) clone in a particularly rainy weekend (I did not win the boggle tournament)
- Flash Climbing (Unpublished): A rock climbing app which lets you create and share routes. Think [Peloton](https://www.onepeloton.co.uk) for rock climbing.  
- [reason-standard](https://github.com/dean177/reason-standard): A portable and safe standard library enhancement for ReasonML & Ocaml. 

## Professional work

I have worked with a variety of industries, teams and technologies.

My responsibilities have included taking the role of technical consultant, technical lead or integrating into large cross-organisation teams.

I worked at [Pirate Studios](https://www.piratestudios.co/en-de) as a senior developer and as a senior consultant at a software consultancy called [Ghyston](https://www.ghyston.com).

Here are some of the more interesting projects in that time:

**Pirate Studios - Website re-development**

_Key technologies: Netlify, GraphQL, Typescript, React, Gatsby_

I led the development of the new mobile (and German) friendly [Pirate Studios website](https://pirate.com/en/).

The site is statically generated using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), [Prismic CMS](https://prismic.io) and some in-house infrastructure I developed which allows content authors to choose from a catalouge of versatile components in order to safely and independantly author new content.

**Pirate Studios - Live streaming**

_Key technologies: AWS, Heroku, Docker, Haskell, Ruby, Typescript, React, Postgres, InfluxDB_

Worked with the in-house team to develop livestreaming capabilities for DJ studios, creating a tablet application allowing 
customers to control the studio recording hardware and livestreaming capabilities.

**Ghyston - Dev-ops**

_Key technologies: Docker, Typescript, Node_

Developed in-house infrastructure and a CLI app to allow zero-config deployments for a range of languages / frameworks for internal services and new client projects, speeding up development workflow considerably.

**Ghyston - Manufacturing**

_Key technologies: Typescript, C#, MSSQL, React_

Created an API and web app to allow real time tracking and reporting on assembly lines.

**Ghyston - Health care**

_Key technologies: C#, PostgreSQL, Typescript, React, Redux_

Led the web team for a care-home digitization project which enabled carers to save hours each day filling in paper work, enabling them to spend more time with residents.

**Ghyston - Mobile**

_Key technologies: React Native, Javascript, Redux_

Trained a team of developers with no prior mobile experience in modern best practices. Delivered a new mobile app and put in place the infrastructure and processes needed for the team to take over the project post release.

## Open source

I am an active [open-source contributor](https://github.com/Dean177) in my spare time.
