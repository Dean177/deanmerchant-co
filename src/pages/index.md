I am a UK based full-stack engineer with a particular enthiusiasm for front end work (❤️ React).

I love learning new technologies, languages, rock climbing and trying to get other people as enthusiastic about those pursuits as I am.

I have just finished a year long sabatical which I used to tour europe's best rock climbing destinations.

I am always looking for new opportunities, don't hesitate to reach out by email. You can find my [full CV here](/cv).
